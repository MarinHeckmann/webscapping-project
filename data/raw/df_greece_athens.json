Athens’ original settlement was founded on this rocky outcrop and it has seen modifications through the millennia. The site includes four sacred buildings, all from the Golden Age of Pericles (461-429BCE). The steep ascent to the summit leads to the Propylaea, a monumental entrance to the site in Ionic and Doric styles. The Temple of Athena Nike is to the left of the Propylaea; the original was demolished in 480 BCE by the Persians and a new temple was built over the remains. It was  damaged again by Turkish forces in the 17th century but was beautifully restored after the independence of Greece in 1834. The Parthenon is the largest building on the Acropolis and an icon of Western civilisation. Built entirely from marble, it was intended as a sanctuary for the goddess Athena and housed a massive statue of her, long since lost to history. Despite the tourists, the perfect harmony of the structure is still awe-inspiring. The Erechtheion temple is a dual shrine to Athena and Poseidon-Erechtheus and was built on the site of the mythical battle between the two deities. The south side features a series of six support columns designed as maidens or caryatids.",

It also features a chef’s table, enabling guests to interact with the chef at close quarters as he prepares his dishes. An excellent selection of wines and a highly original non-alcoholic drinks pairing option adds to the appeal."

            "description": "(Temporarily closed for refurbishment) As soon as French-born chef Jean-Charles Métayer set eyes on this delightful whitewashed villa he is said to have fallen in love with it and immediately decided to set up a restaurant here. On his menus (one with 9 courses, the other 12), guests can savour contemporary cuisine that constantly interlinks French and Greek culinary influences, as both countries are key components of the chef’s unique career and life. The delicious and unusual “chocolate and mushroom textures” dessert definitely came as a surprise!"

            "description": "When you’re thinking about a restaurant for a special occasion, the aim is to enjoy a unique experience. This is precisely the case at Botrini’s, where guests can embark upon a gastronomic journey that tells the chefs’ personal stories which unfold between stunning Greece (Corfu and Thessaly), and romantic Tuscany. Chef Ettore Botrini, who is at the helm of this restaurant, shows himself to be a superb ambassador for cuisine that is a fusion of both countries; while his right-hand man, chef Nikos Billis, dedicates himself to creating dishes that feature natural ingredients and have their roots in traditional cuisine. Occupying a former school on the outskirts of Athens, the restaurant’s interior features an elegant dining room with an open-view kitchen, the option of dining at the chef’s table or, in fine weather, in a pleasant outdoor space. The menu comes in two versions (Peripatos and Taksidi), both with the option of adding extra dishes to make the experience even more memorable."

Here, the relaxing ambience is in perfect harmony with superb views of the fishing boats moored out front. Traditionally, Piraeus is known as the port of Athens, hence the plethora of tavernas and restaurants specialising in fish and seafood located here. Varoulko Seaside follows the same influence, although chef Lefteris Lazarou takes his maritime cuisine to another level. The freshest ingredients are key to his cuisine which is based around the catch of the day (sea bass, red mullet, grouper, tuna, shrimp, prawns etc) and presented on an à la carte and two tasting menus."

            "description": "Located in Vouliagmeni (an upmarket beach area on the shores of the Saronic Gulf just half an hour from Athens), this restaurant occupying a delightful internal patio in The Margi luxury hotel will come as a pleasant surprise. Here, in a verdant setting away from the centre of Athens, it is much easier to showcase the restaurant’s “From Farm to Fork” philosophy and concept. Chef Panagiotis Giakalis’ cuisine is presented on two tasting menus that champion modern Greek cooking of a high technical level, with particular emphasis on flavours from Greece and from the wider Mediterranean, wherever possible using ingredients (eggs, vegetables, fruit, olive oil, wine etc) sourced from their own estate. The covered side porch, the olive trees planted in huge pots, and the romantic candlelit ambience at night are particularly impressive, plus the hotel also owns a farm that guests can visit and enjoy a meal in beautiful natural surroundings."

            "description": "If you’re keen to escape the hustle and bustle of Athens, why not consider a visit to the Four Seasons Astir Palace Hotel, a luxury resort located on an archipelago to the south of the Greek capital? At Pelagos, a restaurant that delights guests with its spacious sea-view terrace, enjoy Mediterranean cuisine with an Italian touch and classic French influence. In the kitchen, where talented chef Luca Piscazzi is at the helm, the cooking showcases a successful fusion of solid technique which extracts maximum benefit from local ingredients. The end result is highlighted on three tasting menus: Discovery, designed in the winter, when the chef explores the islands in search of ingredients and inspiration to bring life to the menu; Adventure, the most extensive, combining creations from the other two options; and the enticing The Best Of, that brings together superb dishes created by the chef during his career. We recommend booking a table on the veranda to enjoy the magical views."
