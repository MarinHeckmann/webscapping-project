            "description": "Created by the Spanish architect Antonio Gaudí, Parc Güell is a fantasy-land that combines features of the natural landscape with Gaudí’s architectural extravagance to create a park that is a popular stop for visitors to Barcelona. Constructed between 1910 and 1914, the park was intended as a residential garden city inspired by the English garden city movement, but was not a commercial success and became municipal property in 1923. Climbing up the side of a hill to the north of Barcelona and offering excellent views of the city, the park has fantastic pavilions, stairways, columned halls and the giant lizard that divides the grand stairway. Guadí's former residence - Casa-Museu Gaudí - houses a collection of furnishings and memorabilia.",

Despite these ongoing construction works, the Sagrada Família is Barcelona's most visited attraction and with thousands of visitors every day, queues are long (timed-tickets available online).

Celebration might sound wrong—after all, they lost—but having undergone 14 months of siege beforehand, the day is a tribute to the Catalan lives lost, to regional identity, and to freedom. Back to the mural though. Catalan photographer Joan Fontcuberta asked readers ofEl Periódiconewspaper to send him photographs of their own moments of freedom. Fontcuberta and ceramicist Toni Cumella then printed 4,000 of these personal shots onto mosaics, arranging them by color and density so that, from afar, the 26-foot-tall mural shows two people kissing. This kiss—a symbol of affection, empathy, and liberty—felt so poignant that the local government never took it down.",

The city’s grandest park began life as a collaboration between entrepreneur Eusebi Güell (hence the park’s name) and Antoni Gaudí. Güell’s vision was to build an estate for affluent families—Gaudí planned 60 homes, a market, and gardens inspired by British parks (which explains the English spelling of the Catalan word parc), but the scheme never took off. Work stopped in 1914, with only two houses completed, including today’s Porter’s Lodge. Success came later—the park is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Park Güell is so iconic, so fantastical, it’s hard to justify skipping it—though during peak months, tour buses also subscribe to this notion…an interesting add-on is Casa Museu Gaudí, the pink spired building inside the park. When booking, select the General Admission + Gaudí House Museum ticket (€14/$15); Gaudí actually lived there for 19 years, which makes it the home tour of all home tours.",

If you’ve read Ildefonso Falcones’s thrillerCathedral of the Sea, you’ll already know more about it than you think: the novel’s backdrop is the construction of this particular Gothic church, with the lead protagonist one of its stone workers. In real life, the church’s history is almost stranger than fiction: in 1428, it was shaken by a major earthquake. Then, in July 1936, it was set on fire and burned for 11 days straight. Look inside, and you’ll still see the black scorch marks on the roof. There’s a strange sense of calm. It’s put down to the proportions of the building: very tall columns, set 43 feet apart—that’s extremely wide, by building standards. Combine that airiness with vast stretches of stained glass and it almost feels like someone’s pulling you up into the sky. The church prides itself on an everyone-welcome mindset, likely stemming back to its origins, when local merchants (rather than the monarchy) funded its expansion. If you’re in El Born, everyone should feel the atmosphere inside for at least five minutes. Still on the fence? This will help: Santa Maria del Mar is what inspired Gaudí to buildLa Sagrada Familia.",

Mind-blown (and a little breeze-blown), you suddenly see the charm of the amusement park next to it—like its retro-styled attractions, such as a Ferris wheel with color-pop seating pods, built for the views as much as the screams. It’s great fun. The most iconic rides are the Avió plane that flies you, bird-like, around the site, or Talaia, a metal arm that goes 1,800 feet above sea level. Being at that height for a few minutes was once thought to have medical healing powers. Which you may need to recover from the park’s organ-flipping new launch, Merlí—a 170-feet freefall. Adults love the views; kids love the rides. Finish with a gin and tonic on the terrace ofMirablau Bar, near where the blue tram stops. The edge seats rule.",

Beauty, one heck of a backstory to the building, and an extremely central location mean we’ll happily sing the Liceu’s praises.

It might not have the quirkiness nor the hype ofLa Sagrada Família, but it holds court: a giant Gothic temple that looms large against the narrow lanes and matchbox shops. Its site originally housed a Roman temple, some 2,000 years ago, when Barcelona was still called Bàrcino (you can track down parts of the old Roman walls and aqueduct nearby). Today, the cathedral’s official name, Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia, honors Eulalia, a local girl who refused to accept Roman emperor Diocletian’s demand to recant her Christian faith. His retaliation was 13 forms of torture, followed by decapitation, during which a dove is said to have flown from her neck. It’s why, inside the cathedral’s cloisters, you’ll find a pond with 13 white geese. Not statues, but living, squawking geese. It’s beautiful and atmospheric, as religious buildings so often are. Regardless of your personal level of piety, the architecture inside—plus the city view from the short elevator ride to the top—is quite something. A walk-by, minimum, is a must.

And when it’s intense, it’s intense: a melee of aggressive marketing calls from waiters flogging fluorescent cocktails, as well as the absolute worst in tacky souvenirs. To predict your next question: But is it La Rambla or Las Ramblas? Well, it’s really both. Originally, the area consisted of five mini-ramblas: Rambla de Canaletes, Estudis, Sant Josep, Caputxins, and Santa Mònica. They're often lumped together and today the street sign says La Rambla–from the Arabic for “dry river bed.” If you’ve never been to La Rambla, go.  La Rambla has a charm that keeps the 78 million coming. Its building facades can be strikingly beautiful: the opera house, Gran Teatre del Liceu, pulls a crowd both inside and out. At number 83, Antigua Casa Figueras is an unexpected jaw-dropper in Catalan Modernism, all stained glass and mosaics, that’s also a treat of a patisserie. While Plaça Reial (step off La Rambla via Carrer de Colom) is a regal yellow square of bars and restaurants; beside the fountain, find lampposts designed by a young Gaudí.

It’s modern, very white, and kind of minimalist byBarcelona’s standards—it's noLa Sagrada Família—but the coolest part is knowing that you’re seeing Miró’s work laid out exactly as he intended. However you feel about Miró, the collection is lively and energetic and devoid of the stuffy pretense that art museums can attract. (A blue dot in a white rectangle might have some traditionalists shaking their heads.) But there is a vibe about this place that’s as irresistible and energizing as your morning coffee. As well as space for his own works, Miró wanted a venue for contemporary arts research and conversation—so there’s a wealth of seasonal displays. Downstairs, the Espai 13 studio is always taken over by a freelance curator or emerging artist–you’ll find videos, light installations, even personal performances.

Textile industrialist Josep Batlló commissionedGaudíto design this home after seeing what Gaudí had done withPark Güell—his brief was to create a house style that none of Batlló’s other family members would have, and which also paid homage to Catalonia’s patron saint, Jordi (who you’ll know as Saint George of dragon-slaying fame). The result is both grand and intimate—and, per the instructions, unique. You come for the architecture—or, rather, to get your head around the architecture. Influenced by nature, Casa Batlló has no straight lines (because they don’t exist in nature, said Gaudí), stone pillars that contort like animal bones, and a tall, ocean-blue stairwell that’s very Jules Verne. Inside the Gaudí Dome, 1000 screens and 38 projectors animate the architect’s inspiration process. While the LED-walled Gaudí Cube immortalizes his imagination.

The site is vast; you can spend hours circumnavigating it, only to discover entire sections you’ve missed. Focusing on its outdoor potential, don’t miss Montjüic Castle, particularly in July and August, when its grounds host an open-air sunset cinema. Walk around the old Olympic stadium site, taking in the giant spike in the sky: a telecoms tower built by architect Santiago Calatrava.

Today, it’s restored, reopened and thriving–with the surrounding blocks becoming car-free to enhance the community-first experience.

Today, these paved avenues prioritize walkers, cyclists and planted areas, and café terraces dance out across what was once highway. A wonderful walking route is the horizontal street, Consell de Cent. It runs left from Passeig de Sant Joan, a wide tree-lined boulevard known for its comic stores, across to Parc Joan Miró, a sandy, parakeet-filled park that features Miró’s ‘Woman and Bird’ sculpture. Walk continuously, and the almost-two-mile route takes around 40 minutes. But that’s kind of missing the point.

In this resolutely contemporary space, you’ll find a somewhat surprising wood-fired oven in the centre of the dining room, large fish-maturing cabinets, an impressive U-shaped counter where you can watch the culinary action unfold, and more conventional tables for those who prefer a more intimate meal. The cuisine of chef Hideki Matsuhisa, which brings together Japanese techniques and Mediterranean ingredients, always focuses on well-conceived pairings and a hint of creativity and is based around tasting menus that vary solely in their number of courses. We can highly recommend the Kaki dish – an oyster served on a bed of chopped onion with a Wagyu beef jus. The finishing touches to many of the dishes are added in front of you!"

Incorporated into the hotel lobby, the Oria is a spacious, elegant and unique restaurant overseen by chef Martín Berasategui, hence the high standard of its updated take on traditional cuisine with its roots in the Mediterranean but with a nod to the Basque Country. Choose between three surprise tasting menus: Formula Oria (lunchtime midweek only), Tradición (a journey back to the origins of Martín Berasategui’s cuisine and the flavours of the Basque country), and Itsasmendi (“mountain and sea” in the Basque language), which showcases the wealth of the region’s bounty. Resident chef Xabi Goikoetxea enjoys chatting and sharing impressions with guests in the dining room."

            "description": "If you’re unfamiliar with the natural bounty of the Ebro Delta, a visit to this restaurant in Barcelona is a must to savour the flavours of a region that has been declared a World Biosphere Reserve. Accessed via the lobby of the Ohla Eixample hotel, Xerta boasts a contemporary dining room with views of the kitchen. Chef Fran López, who trained and worked for three years with French maestro Alain Ducasse, showcases the flavours of his home region, providing guests with an opportunity to discover its superb gastronomy (eel, oysters, rice etc - 90% of his ingredients are sourced from here) from a creative perspective. The à la carte, which also features an array of delicious rice dishes and always showcases seasonal ingredients (sea cucumbers, galera shrimp, blue crab, wild mushrooms etc), is complemented by four set menus: Ejecutivo (lunchtimes, excluding public holidays, Monday to Friday), Delta, Degustación and Homenaje."

What's so special about this place? Firstly, the food itself is highly innovative, with the chefs playing with shapes, textures and flavours and exhibiting indisputable craftsmanship. In addition, a constant stream of innovations emerges from their laboratory, such as their “solid bubbles” or, even more remarkably, a “living table” that changes as the meal progresses (the latter experience is by prior reservation only). It could be said that, despite the superb ingredients on display, you probably come here more to enjoy the extraordinary overall experience and to admire the incredible expertise of Disfrutar’s chefs. Choose between two tasting menus: Classic, featuring the restaurant’s signature dishes (such as the multi-spherical pesto with smoked eel and pistachios); and Festival, which showcases its latest seasonal creations. One of the drinks pairing options is alcohol-free."

In its bright dining room, with large columns flanking its stunning windows and an extraordinary undulating ceiling that is reminiscent of the titanium panels adorning the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, savour a single tasting menu with a creative and contemporary vision and a wine-pairing option. Under the guidance of award-winning Paulo Airaudo (from the Amelia by Paulo Airaudo restaurant in Donostia-San Sebastián), Jerez-born chef Rafa de Bedoya showcases consistency and flavour with its foundation in locally sourced seasonal ingredients.

On it, he unveils his full culinary mastery – the finishing touches to many of his visually inspired dishes are added in front of guests to enable them to fully appreciate the innumerable (and often magical) techniques that he employs. He always works with the very best seasonal ingredients and organises the culinary experience around 4 different options: Tasting, 7 Wine Regions, Mature Wines, and 7 Million Bubbles. Make sure you book well ahead."

            "description": "This captivating restaurant has been designed to enhance the dining experience through different spaces that reflect both the roots and the culinary influences of chef Jordi Artal: the landscapes of La Torre de l'Espanyol (Tarragona), where his family used to produce wine and olive oil; the spirit of Barcelona, as captured in the minimalist design of the dining room; and the private room with its single chef's table overlooking the kitchen, from where diners can enjoy the spectacle of the chefs hard at work. The self-taught chef works only with small, tried-and-tested local suppliers to create his own highly personal take on modern Catalan cuisine which showcases raw ingredients with a strong Catalan DNA (“floreta” peas grown in the Maresme area, prawns from Palamós, onions from Figueres, pork from Sagàs etc). The two tasting menus feature small dishes that are full of exquisite flavours and delicacy, combined with astute textures and a constant focus on flavour."

            "description": "This restaurant with an informal feel and exposed brick walls is the perfect setting in which to feel very much at home thanks to service that could not be any more friendly. Here, the cuisine is focused around two tasting menus: Classic Cruix (7 courses) and Grand Cruix (11 courses), on which the superb rice dishes are worthy of special mention (the paellas are all served with their special crispy “socarrat” texture at the bottom of the pan!). One of its signature dishes is also served for dessert: the bizarrely named “sad day on the beach”! In fine weather, try to book a table on the terrace."
