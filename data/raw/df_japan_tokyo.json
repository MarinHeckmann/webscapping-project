The vibe is distinctly local and laid back, with narrow streets where traditional workshops sit comfortably alongside sleek, modern boutiques. Unlike Tokyo's more hectic districts, Kuramae moves at a gentler pace, perfect for leisurely browsing. Don't miss Tokyo Riverside Distillery, where innovative spirits like their \"Revive\" gin (distilled from leftover beer) can be sampled at the sophisticated upstairs bar, Stage, or from the street-side counter.

The best way to experience Harmonica Yokocho is to hop from place to place, rather than lingering over dinner at a single establishment. Start with a flask of sake, a few pieces of sushi, and the deliciously funky narazuke pickles at Katakuchi, a charming open-fronted restaurant marked by a white noren curtain separating it from the street.

Formerly of two-Michelin-starred restaurant Florilege, Horio is one of the young chefs elevating the sweet treat to new heights of refinement. She carefully adjusts the blade of her ice machine to shave blocks of ice—made with spring water from Nikko, north of Tokyo—into fluffy, feathery flakes. Shaping the shavings into a delicate mound, she adds fresh fruit and toppings such as homemade syrups, compotes, and foams. Her signature parfait showcases sweet azuki red beans—the classic kakigori topping for which the café is named—paired with cream and flecks of meringue. Seasonal offerings include salted cherry blossoms with fresh strawberries in spring, and blood orange dusted with grated Amazonian cacao in early summer.",

Accessibility is a breeze, as Harajuku Station is right near one of the entrances (along with Meiji Shrine which runs adjacent to the park).

Kusama’s signature expressions are on full display. A rooftop gallery showcases a sparkling, new golden pumpkin, covered in tiles and red polka-dots. That same motif is carried through to an “infinity room” installation (mirrored walls reflect glowing pumpkins as far as the eye can see), while a series of paintings are just as colorful, splashy, and psychedelic. The museum changes its exhibition two times a year, and as it’s still relatively new, it’s only cracked the surface of the prolific artist’s work.",

The Kuges walk you through every step of the process: applying epoxy to the fragments, sanding the edges, painting the seams with lacquer, and making them gleam with gold dust. Instead of the highly toxic urushi lacquer used in ancient times, they work with allergen-free cashew lacquer that won’t irritate your skin.

But sumo is the arena’s feature attraction, and if you’re hoping to see sumo in Tokyo, this is where to find it. Tamari seats, which are those immediately surrounding the ring, are the most coveted—and virtually impossible to score. But the next series of rows, box seats, are as close as you can get. Box seats are top-dollar, but little more than rows of tatami mats lined with red square cushions (with no backs) sold in groups of four—so cozy up, and pay up (¥380,00, or about $279, for a box). There are proper stadium seats along the second-floor mezzanine, but the thrill of witnessing this traditional Japanese sport up close is all about getting comfortable with the floor.",

            "description": "With the first iteration of Borderless in Odaiba, the art collective Teamlab created an endlessly Instagrammable, sumptuous and surreal museum dedicated to multi-sensory digital art. Opened in 2018, the facility, which set the world record for the most visited museum dedicated to a single artist, closed its doors in 2022. However, Borderless 2.0 is set to relocate to a permanent location in the soon-to-open Azabudai Hills mixed-use complex in central Tokyo in early 2024. Boderless consists of installations that feature constantly morphing patterns and designs that seem to flow seamlessly from room to room in a maze-like space. Updated versions of some of the museum’s previous works will be on display, as well as several new installations: a room filled with hundreds of multicolored lights that run along tracks continuously and a series of interactive “light sculptures,” to name a few.",

            "description": "‘Cheerful, fun, exciting’ sums up the credo of the owner-chef. The convivial atmosphere and friendly service attracts customers of every generation. The menu reflects this positive attitude, with bowls of rice with toppings, teishoku set meals and à la carte items available at both lunch and dinner. The dish of fame is the kakiage-don, a bowl of rice loaded up with shrimp. The chef treasures the advice he learned as an apprentice: ‘Offer top-rate food at third-rate prices’. He’s always smiling, trading jokes with his guests."

            "description": "A defender of the traditions and techniques of Edo-style sushi, the chef always puts the guest first, whether service is an omakase set meal or à la carte. Sushi Ichijo feels steeped in the very soul of old-school sushi. Japanese halfbeak and horse mackerel are prepared with condensed soy sauce; simmered conger eel is served with salt and soy syrup for a contrast in flavour. The chef gives pride of place to tried-and-true sushi techniques while adding a twist or two to show his creativity. Honest workmanship shines in every morsel."

            "description": "The round logo on the tabletop menu encapsulates the chef’s vision. The varying thickness of the line suggests contrasts between sharp and subtle flavours; the circle declares that the entire prix fixe menu expresses the cuisine as a whole. Sauces and cooking focus on the classic; the fascination with ingredients is a trait cultivated during the chef’s apprenticeship in France. The combination of the chef’s learned skills and passion for cuisine gives rise to a style all his own."
