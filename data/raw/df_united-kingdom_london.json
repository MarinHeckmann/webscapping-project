There are posh supermarkets in converted train sheds, the coveted Central St. Martins London School of Art and Fashion, artisan restaurants like Hicce, and trendy ice cream shops like Ruby Violet. Granary Square, north of the station and surrounded by restored warehouses, has a 1,000-jet fountain that's great for kids, as well as canal-side, amphitheater-style seating. There’s also the gorgeous revamped Camley Street Natural Park, which is packed with stunning wildflowers and urban biodiversity. Google is building their London headquarters here, an office complex that is supposed to be so state-of-the-art it will reinvent everything we know about workplaces. Add starchitect Thomas Heatherwick's stunningly designed Coal Drops Yard, former coal sheds that are now a super desirable luxury shopping and eating indoor and outdoor destination space, and you no doubt want to hang out at this development in what was once a dark and dusty neighborhood."

At one and a half miles long and a mile or so wide, it's one of London's largest Royal Parks, originally appropriated from the monks at Westminster Abbey by Henry VIII to hunt deer, but now the sort of space where anything goes. Think gangs of roller-bladers on the paths, mad swimmers and chill boaters in the Serpentine Lake, rowdy protestors at Speaker’s Corner and kids aplenty riding horses and tipping their toes into the Diana Memorial Fountain."

Tayyabs is loud (and no one’s on a romantic date) but what you’re there for are the sizzling plates of meat. The main attraction is the lamb chops, served up spicy and marinated in a kadai masala with coriander, sliced onions, and chillies, and everything must be paired with freshly baked rotis, parathas, and naans. It’s a great spot for meat eaters and large groups looking for an affordable way to dine on exceptional Punjabi food."

Entry is currently timed so you won't be crowded, and there are some pandemic restrictions still in place in terms of social distancing, but it's easy to get around and see everything.

One rule: book your ticket in advance. Ronnie's is a concert venue, generally hosts two sittings a night—everyone from Nina Simone to Pharaoh Sanders has played here—and gigs get booked out quickly by tourists, aficionados and fellow musicians. You can, however, usually get into Ronnie’s Bar, a smaller more dance oriented venue upstairs, without advance notice, as well as into the 'late late' shows. The place itself is everything a jazz venue should be: dark, loud and enticing, romantic even, and so very Soho—you’ll probably feel like drinking whisky but Champagne always goes down better. When the music ends, and you fall out buzzing into the street, finish up with a bite at the legendary late-night favoriteBar Italiaacross the road. It’s just what's done."

Located at the top of Ladbroke Grove, it’s a restored Edwardian building that is now a haven for artistic types, holding exhibitions, workshops and music events within its century-old walls. The cooking is textbook Italian, with an ingredient-led simplicity and terrific homemade pastas such as spinach and mozzarella tortellini."

            "description": "The former head office of car manufacturer The Rootes Group is perhaps not where you’d expect to find an Italian restaurant, but Ladbroke Hall is no ordinary venue. Located at the top of Ladbroke Grove, it’s a restored Edwardian building that is now a haven for artistic types, holding exhibitions, workshops and music events within its century-old walls. The cooking is textbook Italian, with an ingredient-led simplicity and terrific homemade pastas such as spinach and mozzarella tortellini."

            "description": "Named after the flowering thistle that’s also known as 'cardoon', Akub celebrates traditional Palestinian recipes, while simultaneously invigorating them with contemporary twists. The colours and intense flavours are particularly evident in sharing dishes like the ‘crunchy mansaf’, which consists of crispy golden parcels stuffed with rice and tender lamb shoulder. Everything is served in a bright, airy space situated on an equally colourful Notting Hill street. Accompany the food with wine from a list combining French favourites with options from Palestine and Jordan."

            "description": "There’s opulence to spare at this lavishly furnished, no-expense-spared restaurant from the team behind Gymkhana. Soft lighting, wood panelling and colourful décor all add to the atmosphere, which takes its cues from the ‘party mansions’ of the former undivided Punjab. Northern India and Pakistan inspire the menu, which provides a showcase for the chefs’ quality produce and abundant technical skill – both of which are evident in the superb mooli methi bream cooked on the sigri stove. Downstairs, in Ambassy, guest DJs curate a late-night rotation of Punjabi and British dance music."

            "description": "Britain, its seasons and its produce are the inspiration behind this Jason Atherton venture that comes with elegant brasserie décor and an overtly seasonal menu of comforting dishes you really want to eat. Kick off with the Marmite custard tart and keep things retro for dessert with jam roly poly or bread and butter pudding. The well-constructed wine list has real depth and quality, while coming with the eye-catching quirk of letting you order by the pint. Head upstairs to the Apples & Pears bar if you want to make it a late one."

The array of menus includes a tasting option, an extensive à la carte and set sharing options for more indecisive diners. The dishes show care, craft and vibrancy across the board – but it’s the signature Knightsbridge crispy beef ribs that steal the show. The endearing service adds to the appeal."
