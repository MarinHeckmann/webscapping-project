The geographical heart of the park is an artificial lake where you can rent swan-shaped paddle boats; a jogging track, which fills up early in the morning and around sunset, encircles the lake. There are a few playgrounds and vendors selling water and fresh fruit. On Sunday evenings in the cooler months, the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra plays free concerts. The park’s best-known commodity is its resident population of giant (mostly harmless) monitor lizards, which slither in and out of the lake.",

There are water vendors, ATMS, and food stalls galore, so the only thing you’ll need to bring is small bills, sunscreen, comfortable clothes, and bargaining skills.

Across Chakkaraphet Road, don’t miss the elaborate ready-made bouquets and stacks of colorful orchids for 20 baht (60 cents) each.",

Given its history and reputation, it will be jam-packed with bodies contorting to the therapist's whim. A treatment here isn't just a firm massage; it's a cultural experience.  The massage beds here are lined up next to each other, with some separated by stained glass-filled wooden partitions. But once you're expertly-trained therapist starts working away, you won't notice the stranger next to you. Also, don't worry about questionnaires or consults; the therapists here are intuitive and can sense your problem areas. All you need to do is choose between a traditional Thai massage, one with oil or balm or a foot massage.",

And while the shops and the vibe feel fresh, the exposed beams and wood flooring are original. There are tons of places to poke your head in, but the shopping highlight is Horse Unit & Woot Woot. The shop’s owner has hand-selected vintage military apparel, bags and medals and repurposed them into fashionable items.

            "description": "Meaning ‘House of Flavours,’ Rongros preserves the taste of traditional Thai cuisine on the banks of the Chao Phraya River with a stunning view of Wat Arun. Highlights include the green curry with rib eye beef served with roti and the tangy glass noodle salad. The vintage décor, including the chandeliers, painted Chinese panels, and wooden furniture only add to the experience. Book a table on the terrace for dinner to take in the view at sunset. Keep in mind that this restaurant is a favorite spot for tourists, so it's a good idea to make a reservation in advance to secure your place."
