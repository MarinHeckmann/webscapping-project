The world’s largest steel through arch bridge, opened in 1932 after years of planning, it’s a vital artery, linking Sydney’s CBD (Central Business District) beside Circular Quay with the North Shore. It’s free to walk or cycle across it—with separate paths on the east and west sides, respectively—affording bird’s-eye views of theOpera House, Luna Park, and the harbor below."

The owners, husband-and-wife Hongfeng Li and Ling Wu, are originally from  Shenyang in China's northeast, and the menu proudly displays their regional heritage alongside classic Sichuan cuisine and grilled skewers. Chef Wei Zhang sources quality ingredients for dishes that deliver bold flavor across the board. Portions are hearty, so arrive armed with an appetite for meals like Chungking spicy chicken, with a plate piled high with classic dry fried chicken studded with chilies and peppercorns. Cucumber salad tossed in a vinegar sauce balances the heady spice. Cumin-scented lamb done in a stir fry style is another standout."

Sleek and contemporary with a space dominated by a U-shaped marble bar, it's hyper-focused with just one tasting menu. Scandinavian elements make their way onto the dishes here, hinting at the chef's Swedish background, and the cooking is both clever and confident without superfluous fuss. Artful plating takes center stage in dishes like the beet roulade with a brown butter and black cherry sauce. Fermented white asparagus beurre monté and sautéed spinach make a beautiful base for tender turbot that comes alive with a quenelle of sturgeon caviar. Braised oxtail with seared foie gras and a brunoise of sunchoke is equally rich and tender."

A bounty of seafood is featured, much of it sourced from local waters, with conventional delicacies like oysters and scallops alongside the less commonplace alligator (flash-fried or incorporated into hush puppies).Diners can soak up views of Hillsborough River amid an outdoor sculpture garden while sipping suds from the restaurant’s own brewery."

Then, Germany might be the inspiration behind a plate of bregenwurst with caraway-pickled cabbage and apple chutney. Other offerings, like yellowtail snapper with amandine sauce, have their roots in New Orleans, where the chef first earned her reputation.

The meat's provenance is what sets the offerings apart: a partnership with a local rancher provides grass-fed, grain-finished cattle specifically for the restaurant's use, minimizing waste and maximizing flavor—and few would dispute the caliber of the end product."

Though a two-concept spot (Kaiseki Room is a separate space), all eyes should be on the omakase, which Chef Andrew Huang runs with skill and precision. Delicate sea bream wrapped around sprouts with shaved black truffle delivers dialed-in flavors, while tempura-fried kamasu, served with myoga and chilled, roasted sweet eggplant, is smart and spot on. After a handful of dishes from the kitchen, they progress into the nigiri. There’s plenty of showmanship and style, but the sushi leans traditional without a lot of fuss, as in the kinmedai, seared, then hit with a squeeze of lime."

Yet, nothing seems out of place, as in sumac-flecked cauliflower with whipped goat's milk feta and falafel-spiced dukkah. Fried cobia collar with nuoc cham boasts a cultish following. Such seductive textures and explosive flavors continue in full force in a dessert of black sesame ice cream with pineapple-cashew jam and Thai tea caramel.The tasting menu, though pricier, is a worthy splurge."

Perhaps most exciting of all are the displays of originality, as in a vibrant hiramasa carpaccio with green apple, capers and horseradish; and dessert is a delightful bookend to an impressive meal.

            "description": "Named after Chef/owner Chris Ponte's daughter, it's only appropriate that the cooking at this bustling, Italian-inspired venue should set itself apart thanks to extra care. That characteristic attention to detail includes efforts, like extruding all pastas in house before slowly drying them—but it’s the sort of work that pays off for diners.Although the cuisine draws heavily on classic flavors, don't expect by-the-books renditions—even the simplest dishes flaunt a bit of personality. Take, for example, mini rigatoni sauced with ragù Bolognese and a dollop of herbed ricotta; it's a departure from tradition that is unlikely to draw any objections. The pizza offerings are similarly appealing, like one with truffle honey, smoky speck and scallion."
