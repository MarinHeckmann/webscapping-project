Some of the rooms are also used as gallery spaces for contemporary art exhibits. The property is pretty spectacular and overwhelming in its grandeur. There’s weight to every room considering how much there is to look at, whether it’s an old cabinet filled with porcelain cups or massive gold-framed portraits.

Avillez explains that all his dishes are influenced by Lisbon’s different light, its maritime shoreline and its distinct districts: in the words of this celebrated chef, “cooking is our very own fado, and our own form of expression”. He recreates recipes that recall our childhood memories, such as the classic “grandmother’s rice pudding” (arroz-doce da nossa avó), which boasts a sublime delicacy and a truly special flavour.

His different tasting menus (A História, O Conto and Ecos do 100, the latter vegetarian), are based around innovative cuisine with a constant nod (both physical and emotional) to his origins, although influences from his adopted homeland and further afield are also evident.

            "description": "The best Japanese restaurant in Portugal, where the connection with the Land of the Rising Sun is evident in the name (Midori means \"green\", in clear reference to the delightfully verdant surroundings of the Penha Longa hotel.Decorative features here include an open kitchen, walls embellished with vinyl, an attractive mural designed by a Portuguese artist, as well as large picture windows enabling the surrounding greenery to form part of the restaurant experience. The cuisine of talented chef Pedro Almeida, supported every day by the young resident chef Tiago Santo, showcases Portuguese cuisine with a Japanese soul which incorporates techniques from Japan and applies them to the best local ingredients. Two tasting menus, Kiri and Yama, are on offer, featuring bold dishes such as cod misoshiro, squid sashimi with a cured ham dashi, and Iberian pork sukiyaki with bell pepper. You can also choose between a huge array of sakes (served cold, at room temperature, or warm, depending on your preference)."

Loco is full of surprises as soon as you step through the door, starting with the tree hanging from the ceiling of the entrance hall – a sensation that is enhanced by its extensive designer features and a completely open-view kitchen. Head chef Alexandre Silva’s culinary philosophy is fully focused on a single surprise tasting menu comprising 16 “moments” or courses, which takes its inspiration from Portuguese tradition, while at the same time constantly evolving and changing from a contemporary viewpoint.We recommend you take a close look at the drinks menu which, as well as featuring superb organic wines from small-scale producers, also includes a range of craft beers, herbal liqueurs and fermented natural juices, most of which are made in-house."

He offers several menus which adhere to the Kaiseki philosophy, albeit with a more liberal approach, but always respecting its true essence, with his dishes taking on a more elaborate and gastronomic feel in the evening. The quality of his fish and nigiris is truly spectacular!"
