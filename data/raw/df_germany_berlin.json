In the heart of Berlin’s central Mitte neighborhood, Hackesche Höfe is a cluster of eight café- and boutique-filled public courtyards dating from 1907. Following a complete renovation to restore the interconnected höfs (courtyards) to their former glory, the labyrinth reopened in 1996. Several doors down on Rosenthaler Straße, Haus Schwarzenberg is Hackesche Höfe’s gritty, graffiti-covered brother, and it offers a fascinating glimpse of what much of Berlin looked like before gentrification swept in.",

What’s most interesting here is that many objects are examined in a critical context—for instance, looking at how they were taken from African nations during colonial rule, with descriptions in both German and English. The fascinating, if sprawling, Berlin Global exhibit examines Berlin’s impact on the world in six categories: Boundaries, Entertainment, Fashion, Interconnection, Revolution, Space, and War. The After Nature (Humboldt Lab) exhibition critically examines the interplay between climate change and democracy in countries around the world. Then there are a few exhibitions reminding you of the building’s complex history: a Sculpture Hall displaying fragments of the original palace as well as six large 18th-century sculptures; the Palace Cellar below ground that includes part of the medieval Dominican monastery originally on the site as well as preserved sections of the Berlin Palace’s foundations; and a large-scale video panorama about the history of the site (“800 years of history in just 14 minutes!”) Plus, a panoramic rooftop on the fourth floor (accessible with an extra fee) offers lovely views of the Berlin rooftops.

Indoor and outdoor exhibitions walk visitors through the history of these organizations and the crimes that they committed. Especially moving is the outdoor exhibit “Berlin 1933-1945. Between Propaganda and Terror” that looks at how the Nazis came to power in Berlin; it’s displayed amongst excavated sections of the fomer building (visible through glass panels) where the Nazis planned their crimes against humanity. The comprehensive inside exhibit goes into even more depth, using photos and stories to tell the story of when the Nazis came to power and the crimes they committed until World War II ended. Both exhibits, plus regularly rotating temporary ones, are free to visit.

Though the permanent exhibition space on the lower floor is large, it only holds about 250 pieces, so selections from the museum’s collection of about 5,000 artworks rotate throughout the year. (A new, larger “berlin modern” museum is under construction next to the Neue Nationalgalerie to display more of the artworks; however, its planned opening in 2027 is in question, as it’s already behind schedule and millions over budget.) When the Neue Nationalgalerie reopened in 2021, the permanent exhibition space featured art from 1900 to 1945; from late 2023 through October 2025, the museum is displaying works from 1945 to 2000, with such artists as Barnett Newman, Andy Warhol, Francis Bacon, and Louise Nevelson. Visitors also have the chance to catch the Gerhard Richter Art Foundation, which has loaned 100 works from the renowned German artist to the museum until at least 2026. You can hit the highlights in 60 to 90 minutes, but it will be a bit rushed. Two hours will give you a much more relaxed pace to explore the permanent and temporary collections, and to maybe even spend some time enjoying the lovely sculpture garden, if the weather’s nice.",

Zugegeben, der kleine Raum - übrigens ein ehemaliger Dönerladen - kommt schon etwas „rough“ daher: Das Interieur ist dunkel gehalten und sehr schlicht, die blanken Tische stehen recht eng, dazu individuelle Einrichtungs-Details, teilweise aus der DDR. In der offenen Küche zeigt Andreas Saul  bemerkenswerte Leidenschaft, Präzision, Originalität und Kreativität. Er kocht mit Bezug zur Region und ist dabei ganz schön innovativ. Wie finden Sie z. B. \"Charcuterie von der Karotte\"? Hier gibt's - wie sonst bei Salami üblich - mit Edelpilz verfeinerte Karotte. Man fermentiert auch gerne und räuchert selbst. Auch fernöstliche Einflüsse wie Kimchi finden sich. Das Menü ist sehr durchdacht und steckt voller einzigartiger Aromen. Die fünf vegetarischen Gängen können um zwei weitere Gänge mit Fisch/Fleisch ergänzt werden. Schöne Wein- oder alkoholfreie Begleitung. Fazit: richtig hohes Niveau gepaart mit sympathischer Bodenständigkeit."

The chef-patron and his kitchen team use premium ingredients to devise really interesting combinations. Their secret? Vibrant stocks and sauces that bring the different flavours together beautifully and give the dishes that certain something. The whole thing comes in the form of two 7-course menus: omnivorous or vegetarian.

He showcases excellent ingredients, which he prefers to source from Berlin and the surrounding Brandenburg region, in an unembellished, seemingly unspectacular manner, and it is perhaps precisely for this reason that his cuisine is so memorable. Vegetarian dishes take centre stage. Tip: The signature dishes \"celery ripe and young\" and \"soup greens 'Seleskowitz'\"can be added to the current set menu. Cards provide information on each course. Sebastian Frank also enjoys interacting with guests and explaining his creations. Interesting wine list dedicated to Eastern Europe and Austria."

A shining example is the delicately cooked, finely sliced and grilled king oyster mushrooms seasoned with a squeeze of lime, sprinkled with a yeast/brioche crumble and served with a mushroom broth with thyme and apple cider, which adds a subtle spiciness. The intriguing tea pairing is a must! The icing on the cake is the decor. Drawing on Far Eastern influences, the aptly clean-lined, minimalist-style interior is done out in soothing dark tones.

In his Levantine-inspired creations, owner Gal Ben Moshe combines his Israeli roots with the culinary traditions of neighbouring countries such as Syria and Lebanon, among others. Made with excellent ingredients and injected with a great deal of creativity, the interesting dishes are replete with contrasts in flavour. The Near East and the whole world are represented here. The food is packed with variety and conveys a personal touch; not only remarkable in terms of quality, it is also extremely original – you won't find this anywhere else – and is harmoniously accompanied by excellent wine recommendations courtesy of the exceedingly friendly hostess and outstanding sommelier Jacqueline Lorenz. The 530-strong wine list features a selection from Israel, Syria and Lebanon. All wines are also available by the glass."

            "description": "Very close to Ku'damm, this chic and laid-back establishment is run by a family that already has restaurants in St Petersburg and Moscow. The premises actually used to be home to Berlin's smallest bar. A charming pavement terrace beckons in front of the restaurant. Their Italian cuisine (including classics such as vitello tonnato or pasta) also draws on international and seasonal influences. Opt for the \"Greatest Hits\" set menu (two or more people) for a tempting selection of dishes. Nicely curated wine list. The wine cellar can also be booked for private dinners or chef's table events."
