            "description": "Cenk Debensason has travelled extensively over the years, and this has shaped his personality as a chef. In brief, he grew up in Istanbul, trained in France, and matured as a chef in the United States. You also get a sense of his journey in his dishes. His spicy twist on a vol-au-vent, featuring al dente green asparagus and a lively gribiche sauce, showcases his understanding of French cooking. The chef seamlessly blends classic techniques with Asian flavours, for example in his perfectly seared sea bass, which he elevates with the intense sweet and sour complexity of a Thai sauce. The versatility of this cuisine will keep you on your toes throughout the entire meal. The vintage feel of this stylish 1960s villa is a perfect match for Cenk Debensason's personality. Be sure to visit the Listening Room on the upper floor before or after your meal to enjoy a delicious drink and the chef's carefully curated playlist – sometimes DJs also play. Alternatively, explore Ritmo, an atmospheric space in the same building where you can choose from a small mezze menu. A visit to Arkestra is an experience you won't forget in a hurry."

Whether you choose a table on the large terrace, in the bar or in the restaurant, the setting is as hip as it is minimalist. The stunning view over the Bosporus and the Asian part of the city is quite a sight to behold. Modern Japanese and South American influences are blended here with great precision. Think sea bass cooked in a light tempura batter and served with a vinaigrette in which chopped pineapple and orange create surprising nuances. The menu is impressive, and the omakase menu aptly captures the essence of the kitchen's offerings. The selection of signature cocktails, Turkish wines, and sakes is simply delightful."

In brief, he grew up in Istanbul, trained in France, and matured as a chef in the United States. You also get a sense of his journey in his dishes. His spicy twist on a vol-au-vent, featuring al dente green asparagus and a lively gribiche sauce, showcases his understanding of French cooking. The chef seamlessly blends classic techniques with Asian flavours, for example in his perfectly seared sea bass, which he elevates with the intense sweet and sour complexity of a Thai sauce. The versatility of this cuisine will keep you on your toes throughout the entire meal. The vintage feel of this stylish 1960s villa is a perfect match for Cenk Debensason's personality. Be sure to visit the Listening Room on the upper floor before or after your meal to enjoy a delicious drink and the chef's carefully curated playlist – sometimes DJs also play. Alternatively, explore Ritmo, an atmospheric space in the same building where you can choose from a small mezze menu. A visit to Arkestra is an experience you won't forget in a hurry."

As the name suggests, it brings you a taste of Italy. The dishes served here are not unnecessarily complicated, but they have that je-ne-sais-quoi that makes Italian cuisine so beloved. The menu includes mouthwatering options, such homemade salsiccia made with succulent lamb, salty pecorino cheese and pancetta with a celery puree, as well as an original take on vitello tonnato. Rest assured: at Aida Vino e Cucina you can relish delicious food without breaking the bank."

            "description": "Here you’ll find it's easy to forget you're in the metropolis of Istanbul. You’re actually in the Yeniköy district, in the north of the city, just beyond the exclusive marina you pass on the way (taking the Bosphorus ferry over is a must). Behind its charming façade, this rural-style restaurant awaits with its cosy, romantic interior and a terrace to the rear where you feel cut off from the world. This enchanting spot perfectly suits Zeynep Pınar Taşdemir's highly individual style. Seasonal ingredients are showcased on the menu. The young chef likes to express her creativity with vegetables and herbs. Pumpkin puree is imbued with the potent freshness of za'atar and combined with pickled vegetables and warm olives in a spicy sauce. A robust dish that is full of character and pleasingly harmonious thanks to its subtle acidity. This chef is adept at balancing spicy, savoury flavours with tangy aromas. She creates exciting dishes that let the regional produce do the talking."

            "description": "Located in the Ritz Carlton Hotel, the Istanbul branch of the Nobu restaurant chain embraces the Eastern facets of this cosmopolitan city. Whether you choose a table on the large terrace, in the bar or in the restaurant, the setting is as hip as it is minimalist. The stunning view over the Bosporus and the Asian part of the city is quite a sight to behold. Modern Japanese and South American influences are blended here with great precision. Think sea bass cooked in a light tempura batter and served with a vinaigrette in which chopped pineapple and orange create surprising nuances. The menu is impressive, and the omakase menu aptly captures the essence of the kitchen's offerings. The selection of signature cocktails, Turkish wines, and sakes is simply delightful."

            "description": "Cenk Debensason has travelled extensively over the years, and this has shaped his personality as a chef. In brief, he grew up in Istanbul, trained in France, and matured as a chef in the United States. You also get a sense of his journey in his dishes. His spicy twist on a vol-au-vent, featuring al dente green asparagus and a lively gribiche sauce, showcases his understanding of French cooking. The chef seamlessly blends classic techniques with Asian flavours, for example in his perfectly seared sea bass, which he elevates with the intense sweet and sour complexity of a Thai sauce. The versatility of this cuisine will keep you on your toes throughout the entire meal. The vintage feel of this stylish 1960s villa is a perfect match for Cenk Debensason's personality. Be sure to visit the Listening Room on the upper floor before or after your meal to enjoy a delicious drink and the chef's carefully curated playlist – sometimes DJs also play. Alternatively, explore Ritmo, an atmospheric space in the same building where you can choose from a small mezze menu. A visit to Arkestra is an experience you won't forget in a hurry."

The restaurant's open space and long, extended kitchen are impressive. The cuisine is Asian with a big nod to Japan. The chefs like to let their creativity speak for itself, a case in point being their take on nigiri with tournedos Rossini that really melts in the mouth! Be sure to leave room for dessert, too. After all, you wouldn't want to miss out on a punchy combination of poached peach, buttery crumble and vanilla and umeshu ice cream, would you?"

            "description": "\"Foxy\" refers to the musty flavour of the Concord grape, but you may also take it as a description of this laid-back establishment. Indeed, chef Maksut Aşkar of the MICHELIN-starred Neolokal and wine specialist Levon Bağış have appointed a team here that understands their philosophy. Here, you can sip wonderful Turkish wines – from natural wines to classic appellations – and savour a fresh, modern and sophisticated take on local classics. For instance, a fresh sea bass tartare, cut à la minute, is combined with a tangy mayonnaise, croutons, grated bottarga, paprika, and subtly smoked beetroot. Prepare yourself for an explosion of flavours! Keep in mind that the menu is more extensive in the evening than at lunchtime."
