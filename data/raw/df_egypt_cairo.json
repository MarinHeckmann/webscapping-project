This makes it the oldest Christian place of worship in Cairo, and one of the oldest in the world. It takes its name from being suspended over the southern gate of a Roman fortress. Reached by a stairway that leads to the courtyard, the church’s beautiful interior features three barrel-vaulted aisles, altar screens of inlaid ivory and bone and an exquisite carved marble pulpit supported by 13 pillars representing Christ and his disciples.",

It is also the largest pyramid, originally standing 146m (479ft) high. Nearby are the pyramids of Khafre (Khufu's son) and the considerably smaller Menkaure's (his grandson). Meanwhile, the Great Sphinx watches over all. Once crowded with tourists, the site has been eerily quiet since the first revolution. A visit now brings with it the unusual privilege of having the pyramids practically to yourself.",

Though tourists came here in the past largely for the Egyptian Museum, it’s now recognised across the world as the birthplace of Egypt’s 2011 revolution against Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule. It is now relatively quiet, though the situation can change quickly and it’s a good idea to keep abreast of the news if considering a visit. Though caution is advised and demonstrations should be avoided, the square is compelling for its graffiti, eclectic visitors from almost all walks of Egyptian life, and festival atmosphere on many afternoons.",

            "description": "Barbecue is ubiquitous in Texas, but there's something deliciously different about KG BBQ. It's all due to owner Kareem El-Ghayesh. Raised in Cairo, he left behind a career in finance to move here to smoke meat, and Austin is very happy he did.His food truck is located next to Oddwood Brewing, and there's always a line for this food that marries Middle Eastern twists with Texan barbecue tradition. From rubs and sauces that use sumac, cinnamon, and pomegranate to Mediterranean sausage with green olives, sun dried tomatoes, and feta cheese, the mashup is marvelous. Don't skip the boneless chicken thighs marinated in honey, thyme, and sumac and accompanied by a yogurt sauce. End on a sweet note like the rice pudding with pistachio butter and mascarpone."

            "description": "Homesick for Egypt, Maha Barsoom opened her eponymous restaurant in 2014, and it's been a good thing for Leslieville residents ever since. Climb the steps to land in the coffee bar, then immediately order the epic honey-cardamom latte.This homey spot serves breakfast and lunch only. Lentil soup is an absolute must. Local lore says it's what sparked her to open Maha's, and after one spoonful you'll see why. The warm bowl delivers sharp tartness courtesy of vinegar-soaked Vidalia onions; charred mini pita adds a creamy body and garlic tomatoes share a sweet acidity. The Cairo classic is another go-to. This tender fava bean stew is plated with a fluffy orb of falafel and slices of hard boiled egg, then sided by an impossibly soft balady."
