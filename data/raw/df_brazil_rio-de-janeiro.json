It is home to what is probably the most recognizable image of Rio: that of the Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) statue, which seems to dominate the skyline from every side of the city. Designed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, and inaugurated in 1931, the iconic open-armed statue stands on top of the 710m (2,330 ft) mountain and is itself 30m (99 ft) tall. The site is best visited via the historic cog railway, which takes 20 minutes to wind up through the forest to a station just below the summit. From here, 220 steep steps lead to the summit; alternatively take one of the lifts or escalators. Weather permitting (early morning mist is common); there are stunning views of the whole city and bay area below. After dark, floodlights illuminate the statue, providing a dramatic sight visible all across Rio.",

This is reflected in the Afetividade and Criatividade menus (with two and four main courses, respectively) which pay homage to the different regions of Brazil. The kitchen is situated upstairs, hence the almost constant and careful movement of trays up and down the stairs. What impressed us first and foremost was the creativity of the starters, including the superb oysters with jabuticaba, and the selection of appetisers to eat with your hands, some of which are crunchy, some Brazilian, and others inspired by Japanese cuisine."

And secondly, the fact that food is served in bowls for sharing, to add to the sense of home-style cooking. The staff here recommend four dishes for two people including delicacies such as the fillet steak au poivre with a sauce that will make your mouth water, accompanied by cassava puff pastry and broccoli with Grana Padano cheese. To finish your meal, don’t miss the impressively textured melted chocolate Carola cake."

It’s hard to forget the octopus with jambu fruit (a dish with a profusion of colours and textures that includes pasta cooked in a moqueca sauce) or the delicious cheesecake that takes on its own personality!

Occupying a house in the quiet Jardim Botânico district, this is the domain of chef Roberta Sudbrack who describes it as a space in which to “tell and eat stories”. Inside, the decor is modest yet welcoming, with an impressive wood-fired oven next to the main dining room, plus a charming open kitchen, from which comforting home-style dishes emerge prepared with ingredients from small-scale local producers. As a result, the menu changes daily in line with market availability and freshness. However, one mainstay that is always on the menu is the superbly textured and irresistibly flavoured chocolate cake (“bolo de chocolate molhadinho”)."

It’s hard to forget the octopus with jambu fruit (a dish with a profusion of colours and textures that includes pasta cooked in a moqueca sauce) or the delicious cheesecake that takes on its own personality!
