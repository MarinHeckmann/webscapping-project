            "description": "Remodelled from an old opium refinery, Hoa Túc boasts an al fresco dining area steeped in an early 1900s circa Parisian vibe, while the Colonial-style interior pays homage to Vietnam’s history. On the menu, traditional Vietnamese dishes are updated thanks to fancy presentations. Start with refreshing pink pomelo salad with crabmeat and shrimps, followed by bò lá lốt bánh hỏi (grilled beef wrapped in betel leaves on a rice noodle nest)."
