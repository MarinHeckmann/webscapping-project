The palace itself is exquisitely Baroque, with elegant, perfect symmetry and ornate decorations. Inside, there are walls plastered in frescoes, immaculate stucco work, and grand halls of opulent, gilded marble. Palazzo Spada houses an incredible art collection, with paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts by artists including Titian and Caravaggio.

One of the most remarkable features is the underground area known as thehypogeum—a subterranean complex of chambers and passageways. Visitors can explore several interconnected rooms, including reception areas (atria), living quarters (cubicula), kitchens, and courtyards.

The mood changes from urban at the beginning to monumental at the end; it's a bit of work, but rewards those willing to do it with a unique perspective on Roman history and some of the best views of the city. Best to do the walk during the day, or early in the morning if it's summer. If you're on a tight schedule, don't want to brave the hill in the heat, or just want to get a view, skip the hike and take a taxi directly to Piazzale Garibaldi.",

You get to see first-hand how the rich Romans lived, using their very own aqueduct–the same one that feeds the Trevi fountain–for their running water. The entrance is unassuming, and if you hadn’t been told it was there it would be easy to walk right past. There’s a fairly comprehensive website but all bookings are made (and confirmed) via a Whatsapp chat. Skip the guided tour—there were 8 of us in the tour group, but we shared the same (small) space with  self-guided individuals, many of whom had just showed up and booked on the day.

Chef Federico Delmonte skilfully searches out “poor” varieties of fish which are nonetheless full of flavour on an open menu that is adjusted according to the catch of the day. The chef’s native Fano makes an appearance in a few recipes from the Marche, including the famous brodetto (a typical fish soup)."

Dishes include artichokes (both Roman- and Jewish-style), pasta with rich local sauces, offal specialities (“quinto quarto”), and delicious roast meats among the main courses. For dessert, we recommend the chocolate “tenerina” cake or the ricotta with sour cherries."

The terrace has also had a face-lift, but fortunately the view hasn’t changed – however many times you come here, you find that your memory never quite does justice to the magnificent and expansive views of the capital. Below Monte Mario hill, the whole of Rome, encircled by hills, is spread out before you, appearing silent and enchanted, almost as if it were dozing. Although he’s been at the helm here since 1994, Heinz Beck’s enthusiasm remains undiminished, as he continues to update his dishes, explore new avenues and create imaginative cuisine with a strong Italian and Mediterranean flavour. In addition to the spectacular wine list, there’s also a remarkable choice of water and coffee."
