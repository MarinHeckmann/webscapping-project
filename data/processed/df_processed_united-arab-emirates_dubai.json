Many of the vendors sell the same ingredients—Persian dried limes, saffron, barberries, rose hips, and traditional Middle Eastern spice mixes. Saffron, while still pricey, is more affordable here than elsewhere in Dubai. Part of a complex that features three Jumeirah hotels and an adjoining waterway, the souk has stalls selling everything from the spices, to handmade lanterns, clothes, souvenirs, and everything in between. There are also two-dozen restaurants, indoor and out, not to mention some of the most spectacular views of the world-famous Burj Al Arab hotel. It’s free to enter, but parking and abra-style water taxis cost extra.",
